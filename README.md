# House Price Prediction Project

# Project Overview
This project analyzes the kc_house_data.csv dataset to predict house prices using various machine learning models. The dataset contains information about houses, including their size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other features.

# Dataset
# Filename: kc_house_data.csv
# Source: Real estate data

# Key Features:

id: Unique identifier for each house
date: Date of the house sale
price: Sale price of the house (target variable)
bedrooms, bathrooms: Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
sqft_living, sqft_lot: Size of the house and lot in square feet
floors: Number of floors
waterfront, view, condition, grade: House quality indicators
sqft_above, sqft_basement: Square footage of above-ground and basement
yr_built, yr_renovated: Year built and renovation year
zipcode, lat, long: Location details

# Installation

# To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Project Structure

Project.py: Main script for data analysis and machine learning
kc_house_data.csv: Dataset file
README.md: Project documentation

# Data Processing

Handle missing values and duplicates
Extract date components (year, month, day)
Compute correlation between features

# Machine Learning Models Used

Linear Regression: Predicts house prices based on key features.
Polynomial Regression: Improves accuracy by adding polynomial features.
Ridge Regression: Helps reduce overfitting.

# Results

Visualizations include correlation matrices, box plots, and regression plots.
The R-squared (RÂ²) metric is used to evaluate model performance.

# Running the Code

Run the script with:" python Project.py"

# Future Improvements

Feature engineering to improve model accuracy
Experiment with advanced machine learning models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests)
Deploy the model as a web application
